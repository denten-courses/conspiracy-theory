### Course Description

To understand the modern conspiracy theory---as a way of personal and shared
meaning-making in complicated times---we must first consider its history. In this class,
we will encounter the many genres of political storytelling, from myth to legend,
fairytale, tall tale, rumor, disinformation, and propaganda. These distinct, yet related
genres blend fact and fiction and, ultimately, structure our understanding of the world.
Located outside of systematic, scientific knowledge they nevertheless present us with a
cohesive, if shadowy archive, sung to children at the bedside, whispered at church,
manufactured by political marketers, hammered out on troll farms, or broadcast by
state-sponsored agents through AM radio waves and social media networks.

In each week, we will **first** familiarize ourselves with secondary---scholarly and
theoretical sources, and **second** encounter a number of primary materials "from the
field" of folklore studies, anthropology, literature, and digital ethnography.

This being a reading- and research-intensive curriculum, the class is open to graduate
students from all departments. The students should expect to synthesize ~100 pages of
reading per week, write short response papers, and complete a final project based on
original archival research.

All readings will be linked from the syllabus. Please print and bring to class when
possible.

### Class and University Policies

**The usage of electronic devices is strongly discouraged in the classroom.**

When in doubt, cite! Plagiarism is insulting to your fellow students, your instructors,
and to the research community at large. It wastes my time and yours, and is, ultimately,
not worth the risk. Consult Columbia’s guidelines at
<http://www.college.columbia.edu/academics/integrity> or ask me for help early in the
writing process.
