# Conspiracy Theory

### Course Description

In this class, we'll dive into the wild, weird, and fascinating world of political
storytelling. From epic myths and legendary heroes to fairy tales, rumors, tall tales, and even
modern propaganda --- we'll explore stories that mix fact and fiction to shape how we see the
world. These stories might not always be factually accurate, but they're everywhere --- bedtime
stories whispered to kids, gossip passed along in communities, political slogans created in
strategy rooms, and viral memes made in troll farms. Come ready to decode, discuss, and have
fun exploring how these tales influence our everyday lives!
